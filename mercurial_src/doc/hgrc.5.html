<h2><a name="_name"></a>NAME</h2>
<p>hgrc - configuration files for Mercurial</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="_synopsis"></a>SYNOPSIS</h2>
<p>The Mercurial system uses a set of configuration files to control
aspects of its behavior.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="_files"></a>FILES</h2>
<p>Mercurial reads configuration data from several files, if they exist.
The names of these files depend on the system on which Mercurial is
installed. <tt>*.rc</tt> files from a single directory are read in
alphabetical order, later ones overriding earlier ones. Where multiple
paths are given below, settings from later paths override earlier
ones.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
(Unix) <tt>&lt;install-root&gt;/etc/mercurial/hgrc.d/*.rc</tt>
</dt>
<dt>
(Unix) <tt>&lt;install-root&gt;/etc/mercurial/hgrc</tt>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Per-installation configuration files, searched for in the
    directory where Mercurial is installed. <tt>&lt;install-root&gt;</tt> is the
    parent directory of the hg executable (or symlink) being run. For
    example, if installed in <tt>/shared/tools/bin/hg</tt>, Mercurial will look
    in <tt>/shared/tools/etc/mercurial/hgrc</tt>. Options in these files apply
    to all Mercurial commands executed by any user in any directory.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
(Unix) <tt>/etc/mercurial/hgrc.d/*.rc</tt>
</dt>
<dt>
(Unix) <tt>/etc/mercurial/hgrc</tt>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Per-system configuration files, for the system on which Mercurial
    is running. Options in these files apply to all Mercurial commands
    executed by any user in any directory. Options in these files
    override per-installation options.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
(Windows) <tt>&lt;install-dir&gt;\Mercurial.ini</tt>
</dt>
<dt>
or else
</dt>
<dt>
(Windows) <tt>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Mercurial</tt>
</dt>
<dt>
or else
</dt>
<dt>
(Windows) <tt>C:\Mercurial\Mercurial.ini</tt>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Per-installation/system configuration files, for the system on
    which Mercurial is running. Options in these files apply to all
    Mercurial commands executed by any user in any directory. Registry
    keys contain PATH-like strings, every part of which must reference
    a <tt>Mercurial.ini</tt> file or be a directory where <tt>*.rc</tt> files will
    be read.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
(Unix) <tt>$HOME/.hgrc</tt>
</dt>
<dt>
(Windows) <tt>%HOME%\Mercurial.ini</tt>
</dt>
<dt>
(Windows) <tt>%HOME%\.hgrc</tt>

</dt>
<dt>
(Windows) <tt>%USERPROFILE%\.hgrc</tt>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Per-user configuration file(s), for the user running Mercurial. On
    Windows 9x, <tt>%HOME%</tt> is replaced by <tt>%APPDATA%</tt>. Options in these
    files apply to all Mercurial commands executed by this user in any
    directory. Options in these files override per-installation and
    per-system options.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
(Unix, Windows) <tt>&lt;repo&gt;/.hg/hgrc</tt>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Per-repository configuration options that only apply in a
    particular repository. This file is not version-controlled, and
    will not get transferred during a "clone" operation. Options in
    this file override options in all other configuration files. On
    Unix, most of this file will be ignored if it doesn&#8217;t belong to a
    trusted user or to a trusted group. See the documentation for the
    trusted section below for more details.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<hr>
<h2><a name="_syntax"></a>SYNTAX</h2>
<p>A configuration file consists of sections, led by a "<tt>[section]</tt>" header
and followed by "<tt>name: value</tt>" entries; "<tt>name=value</tt>" is also accepted.</p>
<pre>[spam]
eggs=ham
green=
   eggs</pre>
<p>Each line contains one entry. If the lines that follow are indented,
they are treated as continuations of that entry.</p>
<p>Leading whitespace is removed from values. Empty lines are skipped.</p>
<p>Lines beginning with "<tt>#</tt>" or "<tt>;</tt>" are ignored and may be used to provide
comments.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="_sections"></a>SECTIONS</h2>
<p>This section describes the different sections that may appear in a
Mercurial "hgrc" file, the purpose of each section, its possible keys,
and their possible values.</p>
<a name="alias"></a><dl>
<dt>
alias
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
 Defines command aliases.
  Aliases allow you to define your own commands in terms of other
  commands (or aliases), optionally including arguments.
</p>
<p>Alias definitions consist of lines of the form:</p>
<pre>&lt;alias&gt; = &lt;command&gt; [&lt;argument]...</pre>
<p>For example, this definition:</p>
<pre>latest = log --limit 5</pre>
<p>creates a new command <tt>latest</tt> that shows only the five most recent
changesets. You can define subsequent aliases using earlier ones:</p>
<pre>stable5 = latest -b stable</pre>
<table frame="void" cellpadding="8">
<tr valign="top"><td><p><b><u>Note</u></b></p></td>
<td style="border-left: 1px solid silver;">It is possible to create aliases with the same names as existing
commands, which will then override the original definitions. This is
almost always a bad idea!</td></tr></table>
</dd>
<dt>
auth
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Authentication credentials for HTTP authentication. Each line has
the following format:
</p>
<a name="auth"></a>
<pre>&lt;name&gt;.&lt;argument&gt; = &lt;value&gt;</pre>
<p>where &lt;name&gt; is used to group arguments into authentication entries.
Example:</p>
<pre>foo.prefix = hg.intevation.org/mercurial
foo.username = foo
foo.password = bar
foo.schemes = http https</pre>
<pre>bar.prefix = secure.example.org
bar.key = path/to/file.key
bar.cert = path/to/file.cert
bar.schemes = https</pre>
<p>Supported arguments:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
prefix
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Either "*" or a URI prefix with or without the scheme part.
    The authentication entry with the longest matching prefix is used
    (where "*" matches everything and counts as a match of length
    1). If the prefix doesn&#8217;t include a scheme, the match is performed
    against the URI with its scheme stripped as well, and the schemes
    argument, q.v., is then subsequently consulted.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
username
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Optional. Username to authenticate with. If not given, and the
    remote site requires basic or digest authentication, the user
    will be prompted for it.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
password
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Optional. Password to authenticate with. If not given, and the
    remote site requires basic or digest authentication, the user
    will be prompted for it.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
key
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Optional. PEM encoded client certificate key file.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
cert
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Optional. PEM encoded client certificate chain file.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
schemes
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Optional. Space separated list of URI schemes to use this
    authentication entry with. Only used if the prefix doesn&#8217;t include
    a scheme. Supported schemes are http and https. They will match
    static-http and static-https respectively, as well.
    Default: https.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If no suitable authentication entry is found, the user is prompted
for credentials as usual if required by the remote.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
decode/encode
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
  Filters for transforming files on checkout/checkin. This would
  typically be used for newline processing or other
  localization/canonicalization of files.
</p>
<p>Filters consist of a filter pattern followed by a filter command.
Filter patterns are globs by default, rooted at the repository root.
For example, to match any file ending in "<tt>.txt</tt>" in the root
directory only, use the pattern "*.txt". To match any file ending
in "<tt>.c</tt>" anywhere in the repository, use the pattern "**<tt>.c</tt>".</p>
<p>The filter command can start with a specifier, either "pipe:" or
"tempfile:". If no specifier is given, "pipe:" is used by default.</p>
<p>A "pipe:" command must accept data on stdin and return the transformed
data on stdout.</p>
<p>Pipe example:</p>
<pre>[encode]
# uncompress gzip files on checkin to improve delta compression
# note: not necessarily a good idea, just an example
*.gz = pipe: gunzip</pre>
<pre>[decode]
# recompress gzip files when writing them to the working dir (we
# can safely omit "pipe:", because it's the default)
*.gz = gzip</pre>
<p>A "tempfile:" command is a template. The string INFILE is replaced
with the name of a temporary file that contains the data to be
filtered by the command. The string OUTFILE is replaced with the name
of an empty temporary file, where the filtered data must be written by
the command.</p>
<table frame="void" cellpadding="8">
<tr valign="top"><td><p><b><u>Note</u></b></p></td>
<td style="border-left: 1px solid silver;">the tempfile mechanism is recommended for Windows systems, where
the standard shell I/O redirection operators often have strange
effects and may corrupt the contents of your files.</td></tr></table>
<p>The most common usage is for LF &lt;&#8594; CRLF translation on Windows. For
this, use the "smart" converters which check for binary files:</p>
<pre>[extensions]
hgext.win32text =
[encode]
** = cleverencode:
[decode]
** = cleverdecode:</pre>
<p>or if you only want to translate certain files:</p>
<pre>[extensions]
hgext.win32text =
[encode]
**.txt = dumbencode:
[decode]
**.txt = dumbdecode:</pre>
</dd>
<dt>
defaults
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
  Use the [defaults] section to define command defaults, i.e. the
  default options/arguments to pass to the specified commands.
</p>
<p>The following example makes <em>hg log</em> run in verbose mode, and <em>hg
status</em> show only the modified files, by default.</p>
<pre>[defaults]
log = -v
status = -m</pre>
<p>The actual commands, instead of their aliases, must be used when
defining command defaults. The command defaults will also be applied
to the aliases of the commands defined.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
diff
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
  Settings used when displaying diffs. They are all Boolean and
  defaults to False.
</p>
<a name="diff"></a><dl>
<dt>
git
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Use git extended diff format.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
nodates
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Don&#8217;t include dates in diff headers.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
showfunc
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Show which function each change is in.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
ignorews
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Ignore white space when comparing lines.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
ignorewsamount
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Ignore changes in the amount of white space.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
ignoreblanklines
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Ignore changes whose lines are all blank.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>
email
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
  Settings for extensions that send email messages.
</p>
<a name="email"></a><dl>
<dt>
from
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Optional. Email address to use in "From" header and SMTP envelope
    of outgoing messages.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
to
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Optional. Comma-separated list of recipients' email addresses.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
cc
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Optional. Comma-separated list of carbon copy recipients'
    email addresses.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
bcc
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Optional. Comma-separated list of blind carbon copy recipients'
    email addresses. Cannot be set interactively.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
method
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Optional. Method to use to send email messages. If value is "smtp"
    (default), use SMTP (see section "[smtp]" for configuration).
    Otherwise, use as name of program to run that acts like sendmail
    (takes "-f" option for sender, list of recipients on command line,
    message on stdin). Normally, setting this to "sendmail" or
    "/usr/sbin/sendmail" is enough to use sendmail to send messages.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
charsets
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Optional. Comma-separated list of character sets considered
    convenient for recipients. Addresses, headers, and parts not
    containing patches of outgoing messages will be encoded in the
    first character set to which conversion from local encoding
    (<tt>$HGENCODING</tt>, <tt>ui.fallbackencoding</tt>) succeeds. If correct
    conversion fails, the text in question is sent as is. Defaults to
    empty (explicit) list.
</p>
<p>Order of outgoing email character sets:</p>
<pre>us-ascii             always first, regardless of settings
email.charsets       in order given by user
ui.fallbackencoding  if not in email.charsets
$HGENCODING          if not in email.charsets
utf-8                always last, regardless of settings</pre>
<p>Email example:</p>
<pre>[email]
from = Joseph User &lt;joe.user@example.com&gt;
method = /usr/sbin/sendmail
# charsets for western Europeans
# us-ascii, utf-8 omitted, as they are tried first and last
charsets = iso-8859-1, iso-8859-15, windows-1252</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>
extensions
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
  Mercurial has an extension mechanism for adding new features. To
  enable an extension, create an entry for it in this section.
</p>
<p>If you know that the extension is already in Python&#8217;s search path,
you can give the name of the module, followed by "<tt>=</tt>", with nothing
after the "<tt>=</tt>".</p>
<p>Otherwise, give a name that you choose, followed by "<tt>=</tt>", followed by
the path to the "<tt>.py</tt>" file (including the file name extension) that
defines the extension.</p>
<p>To explicitly disable an extension that is enabled in an hgrc of
broader scope, prepend its path with "<tt>!</tt>", as in
"<tt>hgext.foo = !/ext/path</tt>" or "<tt>hgext.foo = !</tt>"  when path is not
supplied.</p>
<p>Example for <tt>~/.hgrc</tt>:</p>
<pre>[extensions]
# (the mq extension will get loaded from Mercurial's path)
hgext.mq =
# (this extension will get loaded from the file specified)
myfeature = ~/.hgext/myfeature.py</pre>
</dd>
<dt>
format
</dt>
<dd>
<a name="format"></a><dl>
<dt>
usestore
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Enable or disable the "store" repository format which improves
    compatibility with systems that fold case or otherwise mangle
    filenames. Enabled by default. Disabling this option will allow
    you to store longer filenames in some situations at the expense of
    compatibility and ensures that the on-disk format of newly created
    repositories will be compatible with Mercurial before version 0.9.4.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
usefncache
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Enable or disable the "fncache" repository format which enhances
    the "store" repository format (which has to be enabled to use
    fncache) to allow longer filenames and avoids using Windows
    reserved names, e.g. "nul". Enabled by default. Disabling this
    option ensures that the on-disk format of newly created
    repositories will be compatible with Mercurial before version 1.1.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>
merge-patterns
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
  This section specifies merge tools to associate with particular file
  patterns. Tools matched here will take precedence over the default
  merge tool. Patterns are globs by default, rooted at the repository
  root.
</p>
<p><a name="merge-patterns"></a>Example:</p>
<pre>[merge-patterns]
**.c = kdiff3
**.jpg = myimgmerge</pre>
</dd>
<dt>
merge-tools
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
  This section configures external merge tools to use for file-level
  merges.
</p>
<p>Example <tt>~/.hgrc</tt>:</p>
<pre>[merge-tools]
# Override stock tool location
kdiff3.executable = ~/bin/kdiff3
# Specify command line
kdiff3.args = $base $local $other -o $output
# Give higher priority
kdiff3.priority = 1</pre>
<pre># Define new tool
myHtmlTool.args = -m $local $other $base $output
myHtmlTool.regkey = Software\FooSoftware\HtmlMerge
myHtmlTool.priority = 1</pre>
<p>Supported arguments:</p>
<dl>

  Default: the tool name.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
args
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
  The arguments to pass to the tool executable. You can refer to the
  files being merged as well as the output file through these
  variables: <tt>$base</tt>, <tt>$local</tt>, <tt>$other</tt>, <tt>$output</tt>.
  Default: <tt>$local $base $other</tt>
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
premerge
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
  Attempt to run internal non-interactive 3-way merge tool before
  launching external tool.
  Default: True
</p>
</dd>

<p>
  This tool can merge binary files. Defaults to False, unless tool
  was selected by file pattern match.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
symlink
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
  This tool can merge symlinks. Defaults to False, even if tool was
  selected by file pattern match.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
checkconflicts
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
  Check whether there are conflicts even though the tool reported
  success.
  Default: False
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
checkchanged
</dt>
<dd>
<p>

  success.
  Default: False
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
fixeol
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
  Attempt to fix up EOL changes caused by the merge tool.
  Default: False
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
gui
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
  This tool requires a graphical interface to run. Default: False
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
regkey
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
  Windows registry key which describes install location of this
  tool. Mercurial will search for this key first under
  <tt>HKEY_CURRENT_USER</tt> and then under <tt>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</tt>.
  Default: None
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
regname
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
  Name of value to read from specified registry key. Defaults to the
  unnamed (default) value.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>

</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>
hooks
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
  Commands or Python functions that get automatically executed by
  various actions such as starting or finishing a commit. Multiple
  hooks can be run for the same action by appending a suffix to the
  action. Overriding a site-wide hook can be done by changing its
  value or setting it to an empty string.
</p>
<p>Example <tt>.hg/hgrc</tt>:</p>
<pre>[hooks]
# do not use the site-wide hook
incoming =
incoming.email = /my/email/hook
incoming.autobuild = /my/build/hook</pre>
<p>Most hooks are run with environment variables set that give useful
additional information. For each hook below, the environment
variables it is passed are listed with names of the form "$HG_foo".</p>
<dl>
<dt>
changegroup
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
  Run after a changegroup has been added via push, pull or unbundle.
  ID of the first new changeset is in <tt>$HG_NODE</tt>. URL from which
  changes came is in <tt>$HG_URL</tt>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
commit
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
  Run after a changeset has been created in the local repository. ID
  of the newly created changeset is in <tt>$HG_NODE</tt>. Parent changeset
  IDs are in <tt>$HG_PARENT1</tt> and <tt>$HG_PARENT2</tt>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
incoming
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
  Run after a changeset has been pulled, pushed, or unbundled into
  the local repository. The ID of the newly arrived changeset is in
  <tt>$HG_NODE</tt>. URL that was source of changes came is in <tt>$HG_URL</tt>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
outgoing
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
  Run after sending changes from local repository to another. ID of
  first changeset sent is in <tt>$HG_NODE</tt>. Source of operation is in
  <tt>$HG_SOURCE</tt>; see "preoutgoing" hook for description.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
post-&lt;command&gt;
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
  Run after successful invocations of the associated command. The
  contents of the command line are passed as <tt>$HG_ARGS</tt> and the result
  code in <tt>$HG_RESULT</tt>. Hook failure is ignored.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
pre-&lt;command&gt;
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
  Run before executing the associated command. The contents of the
  command line are passed as <tt>$HG_ARGS</tt>. If the hook returns failure,
  the command doesn&#8217;t execute and Mercurial returns the failure
  code.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
prechangegroup
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
  Run before a changegroup is added via push, pull or unbundle. Exit
  status 0 allows the changegroup to proceed. Non-zero status will
  cause the push, pull or unbundle to fail. URL from which changes
  will come is in <tt>$HG_URL</tt>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
precommit
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
  Run before starting a local commit. Exit status 0 allows the
  commit to proceed. Non-zero status will cause the commit to fail.
  Parent changeset IDs are in <tt>$HG_PARENT1</tt> and <tt>$HG_PARENT2</tt>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
preoutgoing
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
  Run before collecting changes to send from the local repository to
  another. Non-zero status will cause failure. This lets you prevent
  pull over HTTP or SSH. Also prevents against local pull, push
  (outbound) or bundle commands, but not effective, since you can
  just copy files instead then. Source of operation is in
  <tt>$HG_SOURCE</tt>. If "serve", operation is happening on behalf of remote
  SSH or HTTP repository. If "push", "pull" or "bundle", operation
  is happening on behalf of repository on same system.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
pretag
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
  Run before creating a tag. Exit status 0 allows the tag to be
  created. Non-zero status will cause the tag to fail. ID of
  changeset to tag is in <tt>$HG_NODE</tt>. Name of tag is in <tt>$HG_TAG</tt>. Tag is
  local if <tt>$HG_LOCAL=1</tt>, in repository if <tt>$HG_LOCAL=0</tt>.

<dt>
pretxnchangegroup
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
  Run after a changegroup has been added via push, pull or unbundle,
  but before the transaction has been committed. Changegroup is
  visible to hook program. This lets you validate incoming changes
  before accepting them. Passed the ID of the first new changeset in
  <tt>$HG_NODE</tt>. Exit status 0 allows the transaction to commit. Non-zero
  status will cause the transaction to be rolled back and the push,
  pull or unbundle will fail. URL that was source of changes is in
  <tt>$HG_URL</tt>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
pretxncommit
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
  Run after a changeset has been created but the transaction not yet
  committed. Changeset is visible to hook program. This lets you
  validate commit message and changes. Exit status 0 allows the
  commit to proceed. Non-zero status will cause the transaction to
  be rolled back. ID of changeset is in <tt>$HG_NODE</tt>. Parent changeset
  IDs are in <tt>$HG_PARENT1</tt> and <tt>$HG_PARENT2</tt>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
preupdate
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
  Run before updating the working directory. Exit status 0 allows
  the update to proceed. Non-zero status will prevent the update.
  Changeset ID of first new parent is in <tt>$HG_PARENT1</tt>. If merge, ID
  of second new parent is in <tt>$HG_PARENT2</tt>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
tag
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
  Run after a tag is created. ID of tagged changeset is in <tt>$HG_NODE</tt>.
  Name of tag is in <tt>$HG_TAG</tt>. Tag is local if <tt>$HG_LOCAL=1</tt>, in
  repository if <tt>$HG_LOCAL=0</tt>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
update
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
  Run after updating the working directory. Changeset ID of first
  new parent is in <tt>$HG_PARENT1</tt>. If merge, ID of second new parent is
  in <tt>$HG_PARENT2</tt>. If the update succeeded, <tt>$HG_ERROR=0</tt>. If the
  update failed (e.g. because conflicts not resolved), <tt>$HG_ERROR=1</tt>.

<table frame="void" cellpadding="8">
<tr valign="top"><td><p><b><u>Note</u></b></p></td>
<td style="border-left: 1px solid silver;">it is generally better to use standard hooks rather than the
generic pre- and post- command hooks as they are guaranteed to be
called in the appropriate contexts for influencing transactions.
Also, hooks like "commit" will be called in all contexts that
generate a commit (e.g. tag) and not just the commit command.</td></tr></table>
<table frame="void" cellpadding="8">
<tr valign="top"><td><p><b><u>Note</u></b></p></td>
<td style="border-left: 1px solid silver;">Environment variables with empty values may not be passed to
hooks on platforms such as Windows. As an example, <tt>$HG_PARENT2</tt> will
have an empty value under Unix-like platforms for non-merge
changesets, while it will not be available at all under Windows.</td></tr></table>
<p>The syntax for Python hooks is as follows:</p>
<pre>hookname = python:modulename.submodule.callable
hookname = python:/path/to/python/module.py:callable</pre>
<p>Python hooks are run within the Mercurial process. Each hook is
called with at least three keyword arguments: a ui object (keyword
"ui"), a repository object (keyword "repo"), and a "hooktype"
keyword that tells what kind of hook is used. Arguments listed as
environment variables above are passed as keyword arguments, with no
"HG_" prefix, and names in lower case.</p>
<p>If a Python hook returns a "true" value or raises an exception, this
is treated as a failure.</p>

<dt>
uncompressed
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Whether to allow clients to clone a repository using the
    uncompressed streaming protocol. This transfers about 40% more
    data than a regular clone, but uses less memory and CPU on both
    server and client. Over a LAN (100 Mbps or better) or a very fast
    WAN, an uncompressed streaming clone is a lot faster (~10x) than a
    regular clone. Over most WAN connections (anything slower than
    about 6 Mbps), uncompressed streaming is slower, because of the
    extra data transfer overhead. Default is False.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>
trusted
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
  For security reasons, Mercurial will not use the settings in the
  <tt>.hg/hgrc</tt> file from a repository if it doesn&#8217;t belong to a trusted
  user or to a trusted group. The main exception is the web interface,
  which automatically uses some safe settings, since it&#8217;s common to
  serve repositories from different users.
</p>
<p>This section specifies what users and groups are trusted. The
current user is always trusted. To trust everybody, list a user or a
group with name "<tt>*</tt>".</p>

    Default is true.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
askusername
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Whether to prompt for a username when committing. If True, and
    neither <tt>$HGUSER</tt> nor <tt>$EMAIL</tt> has been specified, then the user will
    be prompted to enter a username. If no username is entered, the
    default <a href="mailto:USER@HOST">USER@HOST</a> is used instead.
    Default is False.

<dt>
ignore
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    A file to read per-user ignore patterns from. This file should be
    in the same format as a repository-wide .hgignore file. This
    option supports hook syntax, so if you want to specify multiple
    ignore files, you can do so by setting something like
    "ignore.other = ~/.hgignore2". For details of the ignore file
    format, see the hgignore(5) man page.

    The committer of a changeset created when running "commit".
    Typically a person&#8217;s name and email address, e.g. "Fred Widget
    &lt;<a href="mailto:fred@example.com">fred@example.com</a>&gt;". Default is <tt>$EMAIL</tt> or username@hostname. If
    the username in hgrc is empty, it has to be specified manually or
    in a different hgrc file (e.g. <tt>$HOME/.hgrc</tt>, if the admin set
    "username =" in the system hgrc).
</p>
</dd>
<dt>

</p>
</dd>
<dt>
allowbz2
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    (DEPRECATED) Whether to allow .tar.bz2 downloading of repository
    revisions.
    Default is false.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
allowgz
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    (DEPRECATED) Whether to allow .tar.gz downloading of repository
    revisions.
    Default is false.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
allowpull
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Whether to allow pulling from the repository. Default is true.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
allow_push
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Whether to allow pushing to the repository. If empty or not set,
    push is not allowed. If the special value "<tt>*</tt>", any remote user can
    push, including unauthenticated users. Otherwise, the remote user
    must have been authenticated, and the authenticated user name must
    be present in this list (separated by whitespace or ","). The
    contents of the allow_push list are examined after the deny_push
    list.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
allow_read
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    If the user has not already been denied repository access due to
    the contents of deny_read, this list determines whether to grant
    repository access to the user. If this list is not empty, and the
    user is unauthenticated or not present in the list (separated by
    whitespace or ","), then access is denied for the user. If the
    list is empty or not set, then access is permitted to all users by
    default. Setting allow_read to the special value "<tt>*</tt>" is equivalent
    to it not being set (i.e. access is permitted to all users). The
    contents of the allow_read list are examined after the deny_read
    list.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
allowzip
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    (DEPRECATED) Whether to allow .zip downloading of repository
    revisions. Default is false. This feature creates temporary files.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
baseurl
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Base URL to use when publishing URLs in other locations, so
    third-party tools like email notification hooks can construct
    URLs. Example: "http://hgserver/repos/"
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
contact
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Name or email address of the person in charge of the repository.
    Defaults to ui.username or <tt>$EMAIL</tt> or "unknown" if unset or empty.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
deny_push
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Whether to deny pushing to the repository. If empty or not set,
    push is not denied. If the special value "<tt>*</tt>", all remote users are
    denied push. Otherwise, unauthenticated users are all denied, and
    any authenticated user name present in this list (separated by
    whitespace or ",") is also denied. The contents of the deny_push
    list are examined before the allow_push list.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
deny_read
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Whether to deny reading/viewing of the repository. If this list is
    not empty, unauthenticated users are all denied, and any
    authenticated user name present in this list (separated by
    whitespace or ",") is also denied access to the repository. If set
    to the special value "<tt>*</tt>", all remote users are denied access
    (rarely needed ;). If deny_read is empty or not set, the
    determination of repository access depends on the presence and
    content of the allow_read list (see description). If both
    deny_read and allow_read are empty or not set, then access is
    permitted to all users by default. If the repository is being
    served via hgwebdir, denied users will not be able to see it in
    the list of repositories. The contents of the deny_read list have
    priority over (are examined before) the contents of the allow_read
    list.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
description
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Textual description of the repository&#8217;s purpose or contents.

<p>
    Whether to hide the repository in the hgwebdir index.
    Default is false.
</p>
</dd>

<dd>
<p>
    Whether to use IPv6. Default is false.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>

.SH "NAME"
hgrc \- configuration files for Mercurial
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
The Mercurial system uses a set of configuration files to control aspects of its behavior\&.
.SH "FILES"
.sp
Mercurial reads configuration data from several files, if they exist\&. The names of these files depend on the system on which Mercurial is installed\&. *\&.rc files from a single directory are read in alphabetical order, later ones overriding earlier ones\&. Where multiple paths are given below, settings from later paths override earlier ones\&.
.PP
(Unix) <install\-root>/etc/mercurial/hgrc\&.d/*\&.rc, (Unix) <install\-root>/etc/mercurial/hgrc
.RS 4
Per\-installation configuration files, searched for in the directory where Mercurial is installed\&.
<install\-root>
is the parent directory of the hg executable (or symlink) being run\&. For example, if installed in
/shared/tools/bin/hg, Mercurial will look in
/shared/tools/etc/mercurial/hgrc\&. Options in these files apply to all Mercurial commands executed by any user in any directory\&.
.RE
.PP
(Unix) /etc/mercurial/hgrc\&.d/*\&.rc, (Unix) /etc/mercurial/hgrc
.RS 4
Per\-system configuration files, for the system on which Mercurial is running\&. Options in these files apply to all Mercurial commands executed by any user in any directory\&. Options in these files override per\-installation options\&.
.RE
.PP
(Windows) <install\-dir>\eMercurial\&.ini, or else, (Windows) HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\eSOFTWARE\eMercurial, or else, (Windows) C:\eMercurial\eMercurial\&.ini
.RS 4
Per\-installation/system configuration files, for the system on which Mercurial is running\&. Options in these files apply to all Mercurial commands executed by any user in any directory\&. Registry keys contain PATH\-like strings, every part of which must reference a
Mercurial\&.ini
file or be a directory where
*\&.rc
files will be read\&.
.RE
.PP
(Unix) $HOME/\&.hgrc, (Windows) %HOME%\eMercurial\&.ini, (Windows) %HOME%\e\&.hgrc, (Windows) %USERPROFILE%\eMercurial\&.ini, (Windows) %USERPROFILE%\e\&.hgrc
.RS 4
Per\-user configuration file(s), for the user running Mercurial\&. On Windows 9x,
%HOME%
is replaced by
%APPDATA%\&. Options in these files apply to all Mercurial commands executed by this user in any directory\&. Options in these files override per\-installation and per\-system options\&.
.RE
.PP
(Unix, Windows) <repo>/\&.hg/hgrc
.RS 4
Per\-repository configuration options that only apply in a particular repository\&. This file is not version\-controlled, and will not get transferred during a "clone" operation\&. Options in this file override options in all other configuration files\&. On Unix, most of this file will be ignored if it doesn\(cqt belong to a trusted user or to a trusted group\&. See the documentation for the trusted section below for more details\&.
.RE
.SH "SYNTAX"
.sp
A configuration file consists of sections, led by a "[section]" header and followed by "name: value" entries; "name=value" is also accepted\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
[spam]
eggs=ham
green=
   eggs
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Each line contains one entry\&. If the lines that follow are indented, they are treated as continuations of that entry\&.
.sp
Leading whitespace is removed from values\&. Empty lines are skipped\&.
.sp
Lines beginning with "#" or ";" are ignored and may be used to provide comments\&.
.SH "SECTIONS"
.sp
This section describes the different sections that may appear in a Mercurial "hgrc" file, the purpose of each section, its possible keys, and their possible values\&.
.PP
alias
.RS 4
Defines command aliases\&. Aliases allow you to define your own commands in terms of other commands (or aliases), optionally including arguments\&.
.sp
Alias definitions consist of lines of the form:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
<alias> = <command> [<argument]\&.\&.\&.
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
For example, this definition:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
latest = log \-\-limit 5
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
creates a new command
latest
that shows only the five most recent changesets\&. You can define subsequent aliases using earlier ones:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
stable5 = latest \-b stable
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.if n \{\
.sp
.\}
.RS 4
.it 1 an-trap
.nr an-no-space-flag 1
.nr an-break-flag 1
.br
.ps +1
\fBNote\fR
.ps -1
.br
It is possible to create aliases with the same names as existing commands, which will then override the original definitions\&. This is almost always a bad idea!
.sp .5v
.RE
.RE
.PP
auth
.RS 4
Authentication credentials for HTTP authentication\&. Each line has the following format:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
<name>\&.<argument> = <value>
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
where <name> is used to group arguments into authentication entries\&. Example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
foo\&.prefix = hg\&.intevation\&.org/mercurial
foo\&.username = foo
foo\&.password = bar
foo\&.schemes = http https
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
bar\&.prefix = secure\&.example\&.org
bar\&.key = path/to/file\&.key
bar\&.cert = path/to/file\&.cert
bar\&.schemes = https
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Supported arguments:
.PP
prefix
.RS 4
Either "*" or a URI prefix with or without the scheme part\&. The authentication entry with the longest matching prefix is used (where "*" matches everything and counts as a match of length 1)\&. If the prefix doesn\(cqt include a scheme, the match is performed against the URI with its scheme stripped as well, and the schemes argument, q\&.v\&., is then subsequently consulted\&.
.RE
.PP
username
.RS 4
Optional\&. Username to authenticate with\&. If not given, and the remote site requires basic or digest authentication, the user will be prompted for it\&.
.RE
.PP
password
.RS 4
Optional\&. Password to authenticate with\&. If not given, and the remote site requires basic or digest authentication, the user will be prompted for it\&.
.RE
.PP
key
.RS 4
Optional\&. PEM encoded client certificate key file\&.
.RE
.PP
cert
.RS 4
Optional\&. PEM encoded client certificate chain file\&.
.RE
.PP
schemes
.RS 4
Optional\&. Space separated list of URI schemes to use this authentication entry with\&. Only used if the prefix doesn\(cqt include a scheme\&. Supported schemes are http and https\&. They will match static\-http and static\-https respectively, as well\&. Default: https\&.
.RE
.sp
If no suitable authentication entry is found, the user is prompted for credentials as usual if required by the remote\&.
.RE
.PP
decode/encode
.RS 4
Filters for transforming files on checkout/checkin\&. This would typically be used for newline processing or other localization/canonicalization of files\&.
.sp
Filters consist of a filter pattern followed by a filter command\&. Filter patterns are globs by default, rooted at the repository root\&. For example, to match any file ending in "\&.txt" in the root directory only, use the pattern "*\&.txt"\&. To match any file ending in "\&.c" anywhere in the repository, use the pattern "**\&.c"\&.
.sp
The filter command can start with a specifier, either "pipe:" or "tempfile:"\&. If no specifier is given, "pipe:" is used by default\&.
.sp
A "pipe:" command must accept data on stdin and return the transformed data on stdout\&.
.sp
Pipe example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
[encode]
# uncompress gzip files on checkin to improve delta compression
# note: not necessarily a good idea, just an example
*\&.gz = pipe: gunzip
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
[decode]
# recompress gzip files when writing them to the working dir (we
# can safely omit "pipe:", because it\'s the default)
*\&.gz = gzip
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
A "tempfile:" command is a template\&. The string INFILE is replaced with the name of a temporary file that contains the data to be filtered by the command\&. The string OUTFILE is replaced with the name of an empty temporary file, where the filtered data must be written by the command\&.
.if n \{\
.sp
.\}
.RS 4
.it 1 an-trap
.nr an-no-space-flag 1
.nr an-break-flag 1
.br
.ps +1
\fBNote\fR
.ps -1
.br
the tempfile mechanism is recommended for Windows systems, where the standard shell I/O redirection operators often have strange effects and may corrupt the contents of your files\&.
.sp .5v
.RE
The most common usage is for LF <\(-> CRLF translation on Windows\&. For this, use the "smart" converters which check for binary files:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
[extensions]
hgext\&.win32text =
[encode]
** = cleverencode:
[decode]
** = cleverdecode:
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
or if you only want to translate certain files:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
[extensions]
hgext\&.win32text =
[encode]
**\&.txt = dumbencode:
[decode]
**\&.txt = dumbdecode:
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.RE
.PP
defaults
.RS 4
Use the [defaults] section to define command defaults, i\&.e\&. the default options/arguments to pass to the specified commands\&.
.sp
The following example makes
\fIhg log\fR
run in verbose mode, and
\fIhg status\fR
show only the modified files, by default\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
[defaults]
log = \-v
status = \-m
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The actual commands, instead of their aliases, must be used when defining command defaults\&. The command defaults will also be applied to the aliases of the commands defined\&.
.RE
.PP
diff
.RS 4
Settings used when displaying diffs\&. They are all Boolean and defaults to False\&.
.PP
git
.RS 4
Use git extended diff format\&.
.RE
.PP
nodates
.RS 4
Don\(cqt include dates in diff headers\&.
.RE

.RS 4
Optional\&. Comma\-separated list of blind carbon copy recipients\' email addresses\&. Cannot be set interactively\&.
.RE
.PP
method
.RS 4
Optional\&. Method to use to send email messages\&. If value is "smtp" (default), use SMTP (see section "[smtp]" for configuration)\&. Otherwise, use as name of program to run that acts like sendmail (takes "\-f" option for sender, list of recipients on command line, message on stdin)\&. Normally, setting this to "sendmail" or "/usr/sbin/sendmail" is enough to use sendmail to send messages\&.
.RE
.PP
charsets
.RS 4
Optional\&. Comma\-separated list of character sets considered convenient for recipients\&. Addresses, headers, and parts not containing patches of outgoing messages will be encoded in the first character set to which conversion from local encoding ($HGENCODING,
ui\&.fallbackencoding) succeeds\&. If correct conversion fails, the text in question is sent as is\&. Defaults to empty (explicit) list\&.
.sp
Order of outgoing email character sets:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
us\-ascii             always first, regardless of settings
email\&.charsets       in order given by user
ui\&.fallbackencoding  if not in email\&.charsets
$HGENCODING          if not in email\&.charsets
utf\-8                always last, regardless of settings

extensions
.RS 4
Mercurial has an extension mechanism for adding new features\&. To enable an extension, create an entry for it in this section\&.
.sp
If you know that the extension is already in Python\(cqs search path, you can give the name of the module, followed by "=", with nothing after the "="\&.
.sp
Otherwise, give a name that you choose, followed by "=", followed by the path to the "\&.py" file (including the file name extension) that defines the extension\&.
.sp
To explicitly disable an extension that is enabled in an hgrc of broader scope, prepend its path with "!", as in "hgext\&.foo = !/ext/path" or "hgext\&.foo = !" when path is not supplied\&.
.sp
Example for
~/\&.hgrc:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
[extensions]
# (the mq extension will get loaded from Mercurial\'s path)
hgext\&.mq =
# (this extension will get loaded from the file specified)

.RE
.PP
format
.RS 4
.PP
usestore
.RS 4
Enable or disable the "store" repository format which improves compatibility with systems that fold case or otherwise mangle filenames\&. Enabled by default\&. Disabling this option will allow you to store longer filenames in some situations at the expense of compatibility and ensures that the on\-disk format of newly created repositories will be compatible with Mercurial before version 0\&.9\&.4\&.
.RE
.PP
usefncache
.RS 4
Enable or disable the "fncache" repository format which enhances the "store" repository format (which has to be enabled to use fncache) to allow longer filenames and avoids using Windows reserved names, e\&.g\&. "nul"\&. Enabled by default\&. Disabling this option ensures that the on\-disk format of newly created repositories will be compatible with Mercurial before version 1\&.1\&.

it is generally better to use standard hooks rather than the generic pre\- and post\- command hooks as they are guaranteed to be called in the appropriate contexts for influencing transactions\&.

Python hooks are run within the Mercurial process\&. Each hook is called with at least three keyword arguments: a ui object (keyword "ui"), a repository object (keyword "repo"), and a "hooktype" keyword that tells what kind of hook is used\&. Arguments listed as environment variables above are passed as keyword arguments, with no "HG_" prefix, and names in lower case\&.

The contents of the allow_push list are examined after the deny_push list\&.
.RE
.PP
allow_read
.RS 4
If the user has not already been denied repository access due to the contents of deny_read, this list determines whether to grant repository access to the user\&. If this list is not empty, and the user is unauthenticated or not present in the list (separated by whitespace or ","), then access is denied for the user\&. If the list is empty or not set, then access is permitted to all users by default\&. Setting allow_read to the special value "*" is equivalent to it not being set (i\&.e\&. access is permitted to all users)\&. The contents of the allow_read list are examined after the deny_read list\&.

deny_read
.RS 4
Whether to deny reading/viewing of the repository\&. If this list is not empty, unauthenticated users are all denied, and any authenticated user name present in this list (separated by whitespace or ",") is also denied access to the repository\&. If set to the special value "*", all remote users are denied access (rarely needed ;)\&. If deny_read is empty or not set, the determination of repository access depends on the presence and content of the allow_read list (see description)\&. If both deny_read and allow_read are empty or not set, then access is permitted to all users by default\&. If the repository is being served via hgwebdir, denied users will not be able to see it in the list of repositories\&. The contents of the deny_read list have priority over (are examined before) the contents of the allow_read list\&.
